### What is rengginang?
From wikipedia : "Rengginang or ranginang is a kind of Indonesian thick rice cracker, 
made from cooked glutinous sticky rice and seasoned with spices, made into a flat and rounded shape, 
and then sun-dried. The sun-dried rengginang is deep fried with ample cooking oil 
to produce a crispy rice cracker."
